# GitStars
A simple python script to get as many stars on your github repo as you want.

# Disclaimer
This project was made simply for learning purposes and in no way is intended to artifically boost the stars on a repo on purpose. The number of stars on a repo are in no way a reflection of the quality of the project or the code. Using this project for anyother purposes than learning is unethical. I will not be responsible for any consequnces positive or negative that occur on use of this project.

## Working
This script works through browser automation using Selenium. It exploits the fact that a github account does no need to be verified for starring a repo. The script makes dummy accounts (using email id's that do not exist) and stars the repo using the same.

## Installation
Since this project is only made for learning purposes i'll refrain from providing the installation instructions.
