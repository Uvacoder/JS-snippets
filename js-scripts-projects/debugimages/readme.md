## Dimensions

To prevent layout shifts, images should have `width` and `height` attributes.

## Empty alt

Empty `alt` attributes are fine, if they're used on decorative images. If not, users of assistive technology might be missing important information.

## _suspicious_ content

Sometimes images contain useless information to pass validation or automatic tests. These tests checks if the value of the `alt` attribute contains any of the following keywords.

* alt
* image
* img
* logo
