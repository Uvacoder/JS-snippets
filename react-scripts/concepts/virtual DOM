Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of real-DOM

The Virtual DOM works in three steps
1. Whenever any underlying datachanges, the entire UI is rendered in Virtual-DOM representation
2. then the difference between the previous DOM representation and the new one is calculated
3. Once the calcualtions are done. the real DOM will be updated with only the thing that have actually changed
